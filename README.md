# DitHub

## DitHub - Website
  This project was an idea of @tech-gian and @dejvidB so we can help our first-year students to better understand how university works, to have an easy access to schedules, softwares, useful links. As the time passed, we thought about more ideas based on the basic form of the site, so we enriched it with more features. We aren't pro web-designers, but we did our best so it looks nice sa frontend.
  
  The link for the running website is 👉 [dithub.gr](https://dithub.gr/)
  
## FrontEnd 🖥️
  This site doesn't have the best appereance, but we tried hard to make it look good. We tried to play with colours, buttons, links so it can stand like a real-pro website. We think that it's as much attractive as it should be a site for "programmers" (or at least students of programming😄).
  The homepage has a navigation bar, from where someone can go anywhere on the site. Scrolling down units appear with useful information about the unibersity and first semister. We also have a cookies/privacy page to comply with GDPR rules. Last but not least we have created a forum-chat so anyone can ask a question, start a conversation or post/send message about anything.
  For more details about the features we have, I dare you to visit it yourself at: [dithub.gr](https://dithub.gr/) !
